Facebook
Brooklyn Experimental Media Center (BXMC) is the official presence of the Integrated Digital Media program on Facebook.

IDM Graduate Students, stay connected with your colleagues through the IDM Graduate Colloquim Facebook group and also through the IDM group that is open to both graduate and undergratuate students. Please note that both of these groups are maintained by IDM graduate students or alumni.

Graduate Colloquium
During the Graduate Colloquium, all graduate students meet together for lecture series, discussions, and open critiques. The graduate colloquium is more like a gathering, rather than a course, where ALL current graduate students will get to know one another's work. We also want our students to meet practicing artists, designers, programmers, entrepreneurs, and creative technologists. We want to enhance our graduate community where students can freely share ideas, hold internal critiques, and build and cultivate professional networks.

The Graduate Colloquium is open to the public.

For the Fall 2016 semester, our graduate colloquium will be held on Wednesdays from 6:00pm - 6:50pm in MAGNET's Lecture Hall.
